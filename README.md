# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About Bloggy
It is a basic blog posting interface that allows you to create your own post along with posting comments on other post. The comments can be edited as well as deleted if needed.
The interface is made with the help of React.Js and Redux for store management. It consist of only frontend part till now.

You can view the code to see the basic functioning of Redux which often is a 'big deal' for the new developers to understand.

## Inspiration
My motivation to build this interface came in order to learn good development practices and understand Redux as well:D

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
